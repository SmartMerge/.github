## üìò Overview

SmartMerge is building a sustainable ecosystem that automatically rewards bug reporters and PR solvers through blockchain technology. We're creating the first fair-launch protocol with 100% of funds committed to DEX liquidity, targeting the $2.6B open source maintenance market.

> **Currently, less than 2% of open source maintainers are paid for their work.**

SmartMerge solves this by connecting GitHub repositories to smart contracts, creating a seamless reward system that incentivizes both issue reporting and bug fixing with instant, transparent payments.

## üí´ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| üêõ **Issue Rewards** | Earn 10% instantly when you report issues that get funded |
| üîß **PR Bounties** | Earn 80% when your PR gets merged |
| ü™ô **Auto Payments** | Smart contract-based reward distribution with no middlemen |
| ‚öñÔ∏è **Fair Valuation** | Transparent reward calculation for all contributions |
| üîó **GitHub Integration** | Seamless connection with existing GitHub repositories |

Our contracts are audited and deployed on multiple networks including Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, and Fantom for maximum accessibility.

## ü™ô Tokenomics

SmartMerge features a sustainable token model with **100 Million SMRG** total supply:

| Allocation | Amount | Percentage |

| Liquidity Offering | 80,000,000 SMRG | 80% |
| Bounties | 15,000,000 SMRG | 15% |
| Contributors & Airdrops | 5,000,000 SMRG | 5% |

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

- **DAO Treasury**: Protocol fees accrue to the SmartMerge DAO Treasury, controlled by SMRG token holders via governance
- **Buy-Back & Liquidity**: 5% of all protocol fees are used to buy SMRG from the market and add back to liquidity pools
- **Governance**: SMRG holders govern the protocol, including treasury allocation and protocol upgrades
